Robot Control Using ROS


Please find two examples of use of ROS for robot control 1) Forward Kinematics and 2) Path Planning.  In both folders there are two files.  Files labeled "Raw" contain only the relevant math and algorithms that I personally wrote.  Files labeled "With_Skeleton_Code" include ROS interface.
